#Introduction to the Problem
The goal of this program is to develop a simple AI model for linear regression using the Rust programming language and the Burn library. The model is designed to predict the output of the function y = 2x + 1 using synthetic data for training.
##Approach
First, a function was created to generate random synthetic data, which was then used to train the model. The generated data was visualized using the textplots library. The Burn library was utilized to implement and train the model effectively.
##Results and Evaluation
Unfortunately the program still has errors due to not understanding how tensor works properly.
##Reflection on the Learning Process
To complete this project, I used ChatGPT, RustRover's built-in AI, Rust library documentation, and YouTube videos on linear regression in Python and Rust. However, I quickly realized that AI cannot replace human intervention entirely. While AI-assisted tools helped with code predictions and structure, they often produced errors that required manual debugging.
Additionally, Rust's syntax and programming structure were new to me, making it challenging to import and manage modules. Some Rust updates also made it difficult to find the necessary dependencies. Another key takeaway was that Python has far more resources available for machine learning compared to Rust, making it harder to find relevant information.
Despite these challenges, the project was a valuable learning experience. It sparked my interest in machine learning and deepened my understanding of AI's inner workings.
